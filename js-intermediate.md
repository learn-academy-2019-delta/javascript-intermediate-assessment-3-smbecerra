3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer: To ensure the full functionality of a program.

  Researched answer: Testing is important because even the most well-designed programs are prone to human mistakes. 
  These errors can affect a software's security, quality and customer(user) satisfaction, if not caught through testing beforehand.
  Testing ensures that most if not all of these errors can be caught and that the software can work smoothly as intended. 
  


4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint and an object is the instance of the class. 

  Researched answer: An object is a representation of a physical, real world object. A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. 
  Fruit would be a class, with apples, oranges, and bananas being objects derived from the Fruit blueprint. 


5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer: Miscommunication is tough and can cause many hindrances toward progress on a project. 
  It's important to first define a structured and organized way of going through a project at the beginning, 
  otherwise differing ideas and undefined roles will cause a team to be all over the place. 
  
  I think it would be helpful to talk more about methods for organizing a team and each member's role when mob programming.
